## Running locally

> [!NOTE]
> If you've already done all steps previously, you can skip to Step 7.

### 1. Prerequisites

> [!WARNING]
> The latest Steam version of The Cycle: Frontier currently does not work with Windows 11 24H2!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have The Cycle: Frontier from Steam in your Steam library to be able to download it.
> Otherwise, the download will fail with an error message about missing license.

Before you start, you'll need the following software downloaded and installed:

1. [MongoDB Community Edition](https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-8.0.4-signed.msi).

1. [Latest `Prospect.Server.Api`](https://github.com/deiteris/Prospect/releases) from the Releases section

1. [.NET Runtime 8.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win-x64&os=win10&apphost_version=8.0.11) installed.

1. [ASP.NET Core 8.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.AspNetCore.App&framework_version=8.0.0&arch=x64&rid=win-x64&os=win10) installed.

1. The Cycle: Frontier game client:

   - The latest version from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/868270).

   - Season 2 client. See [download instructions below](#11-how-to-download-season-2-client-from-steamdb-using-steam-console).

   - Any other version, even Season 1 works.

### 1.1 How to download Season 2 client from SteamDB using Steam console

> [!WARNING]
> This will overwrite the existing client if you try to download a different manifest!

1. With Steam running, click <steam://nav/console> to open Steam console. Alternatively, you can press `Win+R` and enter `steam://nav/console`.

1. Open [The Cycle: Frontier SteamDB manifests](https://steamdb.info/depot/868271/manifests/).

1. Press `CTRL+F` and enter `4623363103423775682` to find the manifest for Season 2 version 2.7.2 client.

1. Click the ![Copy](./_assets/steamdb_copy.PNG) icon to copy the download command.

1. Paste the command in the Steam console and press `Enter`.

1. The depot will begin downloading. You should receive a notification and the destination folder when the download is complete.

### 2. Unpack `Prospect.Server.Api`

Use your favorite ZIP archiver and unzip the `Prospect.Server.Api.zip` downloaded from this repository.

### 3. Patch the `hosts` file

To be able to connect to the locally running server, you must replace the IP address of `2EA46.playfabapi.com` that the game uses. Do the following:

1. Open Notepad as Administrator.

1. Click **File** > **Open...** and select `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

1. At the end of the file, add `127.0.0.1 2EA46.playfabapi.com` on a new line. Do not add the `#` character!

### 4. Generate and import SSL certificate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not share the generated certificate! Generated certificate includes a private key that may be used to generate other certificates and compromise your security.

A connection to the server is served over a secured connection. The server uses self-signed certificate that must be added to trusted authorities in order for the game
to successfully communicate with the local server. Do the following:

1. Open the folder with `Prospect.Server.Api`.

1. Double-click `generate_ssl.exe`. `certificate.pfx` will appear in the same folder.

1. Double-click `certificate.pfx`. The Certificate Import Wizard will open:

    1. Select **Current User** under Store Location and click **Next**.

    1. Leave **File to Import** unchanged and click **Next**.

    1. Leave **Password** empty and click **Next**.

    1. Select **Place all certificates in the following store** > **Browse...**. Choose **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and click **OK**. Click **Next**.

    1. Click **Finish**. A **Security Warning** popup may appear, make sure it specifies `2EA46.playfabapi.com` certification authority and click **Yes**.

### 5. Add `steam_appid` to the game

1. Open the folder with The Cycle: Frontier and navigate to **Prospect** > **Binaries** > **Win64**.

1. Right-click in the folder > **New** > **Text Document**, and name it `steam_appid`.

1. Open `steam_appid` and enter `480`.

1. Save and close the file.

### 6. Create a game shortcut with specified arguments

1. Open the folder with The Cycle: Frontier and navigate to **Prospect** > **Binaries** > **Win64**.

1. Right-click `Prospect-Win64-Shipping.exe` > **Create Shortcut**.

1. Right-click the created shortcut > **Properties**.

1. In the **Target** field, add the following parameters after the quote ` -log -steam_auth PF_TITLEID=2EA46`. Note the space after the quote.

1. Move the shortcut to desktop.

### 7. Run the server

Now you are all set! Open the folder with `Prospect.Server.Api` and run `Prospect.Server.Api.exe`. It will open a console if it runs successfully.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not close the console when you run the game.
>
> If the console does not open, make sure you have [.NET Runtime 8.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win-x64&os=win10&apphost_version=8.0.11) and [ASP.NET Core 8.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.AspNetCore.App&framework_version=8.0.0&arch=x64&rid=win-x64&os=win10) installed.

### 8. Run the game

Once the server is running, make sure that Steam is running and open The Cycle: Frontier using the shortcut you've created before.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### How to remove the certificate?

If you've installed the certificate for the **Current User**:

1. Open **Start** and enter `certmgr.msc`.

1. Expand **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and select **Certificates**.

1. Find `2EA46.playfabapi.com`, right-click it > **Delete**.

If you've installed the certificate for the **Local Machine**, repeat the same steps but instead open `certlm.msc`.

### `generate_ssl.exe` is flagged as a virus

`generate_ssl.exe` is a Python application packed with PyInstaller and some anti-viruses may flag it as a virus.
This application is a simple certificate generator and you can find its source code in `utils/generate_ssl.py`.

### Body parts are missing with Season 3 client

Currently, the server loads body part IDs for Season 2 by default, so this is expected. You can fix this by going to station and changing your character appearance. This will store the updated body part IDs for your character.

### Prospect.Server.Api does not start

Make sure you have [.NET Runtime 8.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win-x64&os=win10&apphost_version=8.0.11) and [ASP.NET Core 8.0](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.AspNetCore.App&framework_version=8.0.0&arch=x64&rid=win-x64&os=win10) installed.

### Login Failed. Error code: 3

Make sure that:

* You have Steam running.
* You have created and **saved** the `steam_appid` file as described in step 6.
* The `steam_appid` file type is "TXT File".

### Login Failed. Error code: 5

Make sure that:

* `Prospect.Server.Api` server is running.
* The `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file contains `127.0.0.1 2EA46.playfabapi.com` and that the file is **saved**.

If the server works and the `hosts` file is saved, press `Alt+Tab` to a game console that opens when you start the game and check for the following:

* `libcurl error 7 (Couldn't connect to server)` - indicates that the `Prospect.Server.Api` is not running.
  ![](./_assets/connection_refused_error.png)

* `InvalidAPIEndpoint` - indicates that the `hosts` file was not updated properly.
  ![](./_assets/invalid_api_endpoint.PNG)

* `libcurl error 60 (Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates)` - indicates that the certificate was not installed correctly. Make sure that the certificate is present in `certmgr.msc` and there is only one certificate. Try removing the certificate and importing it again by following step 4.
  ![](./_assets/certificate_error.PNG)

* `HTTP code: 500` - usually indicates that MongoDB is not running. Make sure that MongoDB is installed and and that `MongoDB Server` is running in `services.msc`.
